# SIGN-LANGUAGE-DETECTION-PYTHON

The purpose of Sign Language Detection (SLD) systems is to provide an efficient and accurate way to convert sign language into text. Sign Language Detection (SLD) systems is a breakthrough for helping speech impaired people allowing to improve the quality of life and interaction in society with other people.
My project aims to bridge the gap between the speech impaired people and the normal people. The basic idea of this project is to make a system using which speech impaired people can significantly communicate with all other people using their hand gestures (Sign Language).  

The basic idea of this project is to make a system using which speech impaired people can significantly communicate with all other people using their normal gestures. 
The main point of this project is to recognize gestures from the Sign Language to offer a new means of communication. The program will be able to transcribe gestures, done by a signing (speech impaired) person, into written words, printed on the screen of the person who doesn't know the Sign Language.

-> Used ML algorithm and Convolutional neural networks (CNN) based on Deep Learning 
implemented using Python.

-> For data acquisition, images were captured by webcam using Python and OpenCV. OpenCV 
provides functions which are primarily aimed at the Real-Time Computer Vision.

-> Trained a TensorFlow Model to create a Real-Time Sign Language Detection System. 

-> The basic idea of this project is to make a system using which Speech Impaired People can 
significantly communicate with all other people using their normal gestures.
